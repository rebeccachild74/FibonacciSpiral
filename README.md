# FibonacciSpiral
The FibonacciSpiral repository contains a program that generates a Fibonacci sequence and draws a spiral for the sequence using the CImg library. It creates a proper spiral for squences with initial values ranging from 2-5 and the second value ranging from 1 to 15, where the second value is greater than the first one. I examined an existing Fibonacci spiral and identified a pattern to draw border rectanges, then drew "splines" from every initial point to each terminal point of the rectangles. Figuring out how to go about calculating the spline multiplier was the most difficult part. I ended up running multiple tests to find the best multiplier to use for each case, and created a vector to hold those values- that is why it will work the best with certain inputs. The Results folder contains screenshots of all of the tests I have run.
